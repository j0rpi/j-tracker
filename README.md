# j-tracker
This is a replica of The Pirate Bay website, you'll notice this instantly after install. While J-Tracker does not have any tracker software, it acts purely
as a search index for torrents added by it's users from a database. 

J-Tracker does not rely on other sites and/or databases. It purely uses it's own, just like the original The Pirate Bay.

# Features
- Search Engine
